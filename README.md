# advent2017
These are my solutions to the "Advent of Code 2017" event. Feel free to look at them.

## Important
You must have my custom input/output library "IO" installed or it wont compile.

you can find this [here](https://github.com/scott0123/IO)

The file structure should look like:

* IO (folder)
    * stuff in IO
* advent2017 (folder)
    * stuff in advent2017

## Compiling
1. Put the desired day's function in main()
    ```
    int main(){
        day1();
        return 0;
    }
    ```
2. Run the `make` command
3. Run ./advent
